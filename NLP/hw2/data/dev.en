lock onto him , r2

oh , i see it . oh , this is going to be easy
oddball , do you copy ?

we 're on your tail , general kenobi
set s-foils in attack position
this is where the fun begins
let them pass between us
they 're all over me
get them off my ...
i 'm gonna go help them out
no . no , they are doing their job so we can do ours
missiles
they overshot us
they 're coming around
all right , r4 . no , no , no , no ... no , nothing too fancy
surge all power units , r2 . stand by reverse thrusters
we got 'em , r2
flying is for droids
i 'm hit . anakin ?
i see them
buzz droids
r4 , be careful . you have a ...
oh , dear
they 're shutting down all the controls
move to the right so i can get a clear shot at them
the mission . get to the command ship
get the chancellor . i 'm running out of tricks here
in the name of ...
hold your fire !
you 're not helping here . - i agree . bad idea
i ca n't see a thing . my cockpit 's fogging
they 're all over me . anakin !
move to the right
hold on , anakin . you 're gonna get us both killed
get out of here . there 's nothing more you can do
i 'm not leaving without you , master
get him , r2
watch out
r2 , hit the buzz droid 's center eye
yeah , you got him !
great , r2
the general 's command ship is dead ahead
well , have you noticed the shields are still up ?
sorry , master
oh , i have a bad feeling about this
there they are . get them
r2 , locate the chancellor
the chancellor 's signal is coming from right there ... the observation platform at the top of that spire
i sense count dooku
i sense a trap
next move ?
spring the trap
r2 , go back . i need you to stay with the ship
here . take this and wait for orders
what 's the situation , captain ?
two jedi have landed in the main hangar bay . we 're tracking them
just as count dooku predicted
destroyers
drop your weapons . i said drop 'em
roger
roger , roger
those are jedi fighters all right
did you press the stop button ? - no
did you ? - no
well , there 's more than one way out of here
we do n't want to get out
we want to get moving . r2 , activate elevator 31174
come in , r2
what that ?
r2 , do you copy ?
r2 , activate the elevator number ... 31174
get back to work . that nothin'
activate the elevator 31174
r2 , we ...
always on the move
r2 , switch on the comlink . r2 , can you hear me ? r2 ?
hands up , jedi
r2 , do you copy ?
r2 , do you hear me ? r2 , we need to be going up , not down
hey , you !
now , that 's better
you stupid little astro droid
oh , it 's you
my eyes ! my eyes !
what was that all about ?
well , r2 has been ... - uh , no loose wire jokes
did i say anything ?
he 's trying
i did n't say anything
chancellor
are you all right ?
count dooku
this time we will do it together
i was about to say that
get help . you 're no match for him . he 's a sith lord
chancellor palpatine , sith lords are our speciality
your swords , please
we do n't want to make a mess of things in front of the chancellor
you wo n't get away this time , dooku
i 've been looking forward to this
my powers have doubled since the last time we met , count
good . twice the pride , double the fall
get ...
i sense great fear in you , skywalker
you have hate . you have anger
but you do n't use them
good , anakin
kill him
kill him now
i should n't
do it
you did well , anakin
he was too dangerous to be kept alive
yes , but he was an unarmed prisoner
i should n't have done that . it 's not the jedi way
it is only natural . he cut off your arm , and you wanted revenge
it was n't the first time , anakin
remember what you told me about your mother and the sand people ?
now we must leave before more security droids arrive
anakin , there 's no time
we must get off this ship before it 's too late
he seems to be all right
leave him , or we 'll never make it
his fate will be the same as ours
prepare for attack !
all batteries , fire ! fire !
elevator 's not working
r2 , activate elevator 3224
reverse stabilizers
reversing stabilizers
magnetize ! magnetize !
fire the emergency booster engines
we 're leveling out , sir
easy . we 're in a bit of a situation here
did i miss something ?
hold on
what is that ?
uh , oops
r2 . r2 , shut down the elevator
too late
let 's see if we can find something in the hangar bay that 's still flyable
r2 , get down here
r2 , do you copy ?
general , we found the jedi . - they 're in hallway 328
activate ray shields
ray shields
wait a minute . how did this happen ?
we 're smarter than this
apparently not
i say patience
patience ?
r2 will be along in a few moments ... and then ... he 'll release the ray shields
see ? no problem
do n't move
do you have a plan " b " ?
ah , yes
the negotiator
general kenobi . we 've been waiting for you
excuse me
that was n't much of a rescue
you 're welcome
and ...
anakin skywalker
i was expecting someone with your reputation to be a little ... older
general grievous . you 're shorter than i expected
jedi scum
we have a job to do , anakin . try not to upset him
your lightsabers will make a fine addition to my collection
not this time . and this time , you wo n't escape . r2
make them suffer !
come . now !
stay at your stations ! - whoa !
get him ! get him !
run !
do n't bother with them
keep the ship in orbit . - yes , sir
you lose , general kenobi
get out of here ! run !
time to abandon ship
all the escape pods have been launched
grievous . can you fly a cruiser like this ?
you mean , do i know how to land what 's left of this thing ?
well ?
well , under the circumstances , i 'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant
strap yourselves in
open all hatches . extend all flaps and drag fins
we lost something
not to worry . we are still flying half a ship
now we 're really picking up speed
eight plus 60
we 're in the atmosphere
grab that
steady
easy , r2 . 5000 . fire ships on the left and the right
we 'll take you in
copy that
landing strip , straight ahead
we 're coming in too hot
another happy landing
are you coming , master ?
i 'm not brave enough for politics
i have to report to the council
besides , someone needs to be the poster boy
hold on . this whole operation was your idea
let us not forget , anakin , that you rescued me from the buzz droids
and you killed count dooku , and you rescued the chancellor ... carrying me unconscious on your back
all because of your training
anakin , let 's be fair
today you were the hero ... and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians . all right
but you owe me one , and not for saving your skin for the 10th time
ninth time
that business on cato neimoidia does n't ... does n't count . i 'll see you at the briefing
chancellor palpatine , are you all right ?
yes . thanks to your two jedi knights
they killed count dooku , but general grievous has escaped once again
general grievous will run and hide , as he always does . he 's a coward
but with count dooku dead , he is the leader of the droid army
and i assure you , the senate will vote to continue the war as long as grievous is alive
then the jedi council will make finding grievous our highest priority
watch it
excuse me
come along , r2
the republic cannot praise you enough
thank you , senator organa
well , it could n't possibly be as bad as all that
now there i agree with you
in fact , i could do with a tune up myself
but the fighting will continue until general grievous is spare parts
well , i will do everything i can in the senate
excuse me . - certainly
oh , anakin
i 've missed you , padm√©
there were whispers that you 'd been killed
i 'm all right
it feels like we 've been apart for a lifetime
and it might have been , if the chancellor had n't been kidnapped
i do n't think they would have ever brought us back from the outer rim sieges
wait . not here
yes , here
i 'm ... i 'm tired of all this deception
i do n't care if they know we 're married
anakin , do n't say things like that
are you all right ?
you 're trembling
what 's going on ?
something wonderful has happened
ani , i 'm pregnant
well , that 's won ... that 's wonderful
what are we gonna do ?
we 're not gonna worry about anything right now . all right ?
this is a happy moment
the happiest moment of my life
yes , lord sidious ?
general grievous ...
i suggest you move the separatist leaders to mustafar
it will be done , my lord
the end of the war is near , general
but the loss of count dooku ...
his death was a necessary loss
soon i will have a new apprentice ... one far younger and more powerful
ani , i want to have our baby back home on naboo
we can go to the lake country where no one will know ... where we can be safe
i can go early and fix up the baby 's room
i know the perfect spot . right by the gardens
you are so ... beautiful
it 's only because i 'm so in love
no
no , it 's because i 'm so in love with you
so love has blinded you ?
well , that 's not exactly what i meant
but it 's probably true
anakin , help me !
what 's bothering you ?
nothing
i remember when i gave this to you
how long is it gonna take for us to be honest with each other ?
it was a dream
bad ?
like the ones i used to have about my mother ... just before she died
and ?
and it was about you
tell me
it was only a dream
you die in childbirth
and the baby ?
i do n't know
it was only a dream
i wo n't let this one become real
this baby will change our lives
i doubt the queen will continue to allow me to serve in the senate
and if the council discovers you 're the father , you 'll be expelled ...
i ... i know
do you think obi-wan might be able to help us ?
we do n't need his help
our baby is a blessing
premonitions ?
premonitions
these visions you have ...
they 're of pain , suffering
death
yourself you speak of , or someone you know ?
someone
close to you ?
yes
careful you must be when sensing the future , anakin
the fear of loss is a path to the dark side
i wo n't let these visions come true , master yoda
death is a natural part of life
rejoice for those around you who transform into the force
mourn them , do not . miss them , do not
attachment leads to jealousy
the shadow of greed that is
what must i do , master yoda ?
train yourself to let go ... of everything you fear to lose
you 've missed the report on the outer rim sieges
i 'm sorry . i was held up
i have no excuse
in short , they are going very well
saleucami has fallen , and master vos has moved his troops to boz pity
what 's wrong , then ?
the senate is expected ... to vote more executive powers to the chancellor today
well , that can only mean less deliberating and more action . is that bad ?
it'll make it easier for us to end this war
be careful of your friend palpatine
be careful of what ?
he has requested your presence
what for ?
he would not say
he did n't inform the council ?
that 's unusual , is n't it ?
all of this is unusual
and it 's making me feel uneasy
i hope you trust me , anakin
of course
i need your help , son
what do you mean ?
i 'm depending on you
i do n't understand
to be the eyes , ears and voice of the republic
anakin ...
i 'm appointing you to be my personal representative on the jedi council
me ?
a master ?
i 'm overwhelmed , sir
but the council elects its own members . they 'll never accept this
i think they will . they need you
more than you know
allow this appointment lightly the council does not
disturbing is this move by chancellor palpatine
i understand
you are on this council , but we do not grant you the rank of master
what ?
how can you do this ?
this is outrageous
it 's unfair
how can you be on the council and not be a master ?
take a seat , young skywalker
forgive me , master
we have surveyed all systems in the republic ... but have found no sign of general grievous
hiding in the outer rim grievous is
the outlying systems you must sweep
we do not have many ships to spare
what about the droid attack on the wookiees ?
it is critical we send an attack group there immediately
he 's right . it 's a system we cannot afford to lose
go i will
good relations with the wookiees i have
it 's settled then
yoda will take a battalion of clones ... to reinforce the wookiees on kashyyyk
may the force be with us all
what kind of nonsense is this ?
put me on the council and not make me a master ?
it 's never been done in the history of the jedi . it 's insulting
oh , calm down , anakin . you have been given a great honor
to be on the council at your age ...
the fact of the matter is you are too close to the chancellor
the council does n't like it when he interferes in jedi affairs
i swear to you , i did n't ask to be put on the council
but it 's what you wanted
your friendship with chancellor palpatine seems to have paid off
that has nothing to do with this
the only reason the council has approved your appointment ... is because the chancellor trusts you
and ?
anakin , i am on your side
i did n't want to put you in this situation
what situation ?
the council wants you to report on all the chancellor 's dealings
they want to know what he 's up to
they want me to spy on the chancellor ?
but that 's treason
we are at war , anakin
why did n't the council give me this assignment when we were in session ?
this assignment is not to be on record
the chancellor is not a bad man , obi-wan
he befriended me . he 's watched out for me ever since i arrived here
that is why you must help us
anakin , our allegiance is to the senate , not to its leader ... who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired
the senate demanded that he stay longer
yes , but use your feelings , anakin . something is out of place
you 're asking me to do something against the jedi code ... against the republic , against a mentor and a friend
that 's what 's out of place here . why are you asking this of me ?
the council is asking you
anakin did not take to his new assignment with much enthusiasm
it 's very dangerous , putting them together
i do n't think the boy can handle it
i do n't trust him
with all due respect , master , is he not the chosen one ?
is he not to destroy the sith and bring balance to the force ?
so the prophecy says
a prophecy that misread could have been
he will not let me down
he never has
i hope right you are
sometimes i wonder what 's happening to the jedi order
i think this war is destroying the principles of the republic
have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side ?
what do you mean ?
what if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists ... and the republic has become the very evil we 've been fighting to destroy ?
i do n't believe that . and you 're sounding like a separatist
this war represents a failure to listen
now you 're closer to the chancellor than anyone
please , ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume
do n't ask me to do that
make a motion in the senate , where that kind of a request belongs
what is it ?
nothing
do n't do this . do n't shut me out . let me help you
hold me
like you did by the lake on naboo
so long ago , when there was nothing but our love
no politics , no plotting , nowar
you wanted to see me , chancellor
yes , anakin
come closer . i have good news
our clone intelligence units have discovered the location of general grievous
he 's hiding in the utapau system
at last
we 'll be able to capture that monster and end this war
i would worry about the collective wisdom of the council ... if it did n't select you for this assignment
you 're the best choice , by far
sit down
leave us
anakin ... you know i 'm not able to rely on the jedi council
if they have n't included you in their plot , they soon will
i 'm not sure i understand
you must sense what i have come to suspect
the jedi council want control of the republic
they 're planning to betray me
i do n't think that ...
anakin
search your feelings
you know , do n't you ?
i know they do n't trust you
hmm . or the senate
or the republic , or democracy , for that matter
i have to admit , my trust in them has been shaken
why ?
they asked you to do something ... that made you feel dishonest , did n't they ?
they asked you to spy on me , did n't they ?
i do n't , uh ...
i do n't know what to say
remember back to your early teachings
all who gain power are afraid to lose it
even the jedi
the jedi use their power for good
good is a point of view , anakin
the sith and the jedi are similar in almost every way ... including their quest for greater power
the sith rely on their passion for their strength
they think inwards ... only about themselves
and the jedi do n't ?
the jedi are selfless . they only care about others
did you ever hear the tragedy of darth plagueis the wise ?
no
i thought not . it 's not a story the jedi would tell you
it 's a sith legend
darth plagueis ... was a dark lord of the sith so powerful and so wise ... he could use the force to influence the midi-chlorians ... to create ...
life
he had such a knowledge of the dark side ... he could even keep the ones he cared about ... from dying
he could actually ...
save people from death ?
the dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities ... some consider to be unnatural
wh ... what happened to him ?
he became so powerful ... the only thing he was afraid of was ...
losing his power
which eventually , of course , he did
unfortunately , he taught his apprentice everything he knew
then his apprentice killed him in his sleep
it 's ironic
he could save others from death ... but not himself
is it possible to learn this power ?
not from a jedi
all redunits , overhere !
palpatine thinks general grievous is on utapau ?
a partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet ...
from the chairman of utapau
act on this we must
the capture of general grievous will end this war
