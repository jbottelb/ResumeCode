# Resume Code

Code relevant for resume purposes. It contains multiple projects showcasing various aspects and progression of my learning in CS.

### Guide: 
FundComp: Selected Code written for Fundamentals of Computing. \
Matlab:   Project for introduction to engineering including implementation of the Minimax algorithm\
Systems:  Selected various code form systems course. Includes Bash, python and C on a wide range of problems \
C_Server: A server written in C \
Programming Challenges: Solutions to interview style questions in python3 (Problem statements in the readme) \
Python App: a web app with a working API
NLP: Work from Natural Language Processing course

I recommend looking into Programming Challenges for coding concepts like dynamic programming and data structures (in python) and the python app (the pythonApp, not PythonApp) for web development in python. 

NLP shows work with python and machine learning.

I am currently working on hosting an app on heroku with an API to display some web development I have been learning on the side.
